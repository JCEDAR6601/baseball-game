# baseball-game
This is my final project for CSC 101. I have decided to create a radnomized baseball game. 

Overall, my game is just a randomized baseball game. The player will have the option to swing or not. Next, the random generator will decide what happens. It will  decide from ball, strike, hit, or miss. Based on that decision, if it chose hit it will determine where the ball was hit and what kind of hit it was. The hit could also be caught and the player will be out. If they missed it or it was a ball they will have the option once again to hit or not. Once you get three outs the game is over. You want to score as many runs as possible before three outs.
